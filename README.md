<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Film Vault, our React-powered app, offers a streamlined way to track and rate your watched movies. Organize your cinematic adventures effortlessly in a secure digital vault, creating a personalized archive of your favorite films. With a user-friendly interface, Film Vault not only simplifies movie management but also integrates IMDb ratings, letting you see how others have rated the same films. Dive into a curated movie experience that combines your preferences with the collective insights of the IMDb community.

Key Features:

1. Effortless Movie Tracking: Utilizing a single-page app design principle, Film Vault provides a seamless and responsive user interface, offering an elegant and friendly feel for effortless movie tracking.

2. Secure Local Storage: Film Vault leverages your browser's local storage, ensuring a secure and convenient way to store your watched list and ratings. This allows you to revisit and update your movie records at any time without the need for an external account.

3. Automatic Rating Insights: Film Vault calculates and displays your average rating for your watched list alongside the average IMDb user rating, providing valuable insights for easy comparisons and a deeper understanding of your cinematic preferences.

Enhance your projects effortlessly with our React StarRating Component. As a small but impactful side offering, we've crafted a dedicated API file that you can seamlessly download from our source code. This allows you to integrate our sleek star rating system directly into your React applications, bringing a touch of Film Vault's user-friendly design to your own projects. Elevate your UI effortlessly with our downloadable React Component, making cinematic flair a seamless addition to your development toolkit.

Originally conceived as a course project, Film Vault has evolved into a personalized movie tracking experience that now reflects my unique style and preferences. While its inception may have been part of an academic journey, I've transformed the app by infusing it with a carefully curated color palette and minor details to align with my aesthetic vision.
